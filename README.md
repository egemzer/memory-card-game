## About

This game is intended to familiarize new Verily employees with some of the projects and products at Verily.  Currently, you can only play a 4x4 game, with 8 logos.  As more projects provide their logos, we can expand the board to include more Verily projects!


## Instructions

To play the game, simply launch “index.html” in Chrome (other browsers not supported, sorry!) Click a card and try to find its match.  Be thoughtful with guesses, since you’ll lose stars if you take too many guesses. Once you reach 24 attempts (moves), you lose, and your game will reset.

## Contributing

This repository is at Erika Gemzer’s github: https://github.com/egemzer/memory-card-game, pull requests will be allowed! I’m looking for help to build a leaderboard (haven’t figured out how to store results, and no CSS is built yet!).
